<h1 align="center">Java Rabbit</h1>

Java Rabbit is a fun and playful project created as a joke in response to Python's Turtle graphics library. It is built using JavaFX and features a simple text editor interface that allows you to draw on a canvas by inputting commands.

## How to Use

- ### Change canvas size in pixel

    ```canvas width height```
    
    example :     
    ```canvas 600 600```

- ### Change canvas background color

  ```bg color```

  example :     
  ```bg red```

- ### Draw Line

  ```line [color] [width] [start x] [start y] [end x] [end y]```

  example :     
  ```line green 20 0 0 50 50```

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- JavaFX (included in the project)
